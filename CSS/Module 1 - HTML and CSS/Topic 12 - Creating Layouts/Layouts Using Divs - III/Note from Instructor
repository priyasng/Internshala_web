Note from Instructor:

    Since id attribute is used to identify elements uniquely, ideally two elements should not have the same id.
    The commonly used block level elements are:
        <div>
        <footer>
        <form>
        Heading levels <h1> to <h6>
        <header>
        List related elements <li>,<ol>, <ul>
        <p>
        <nav>
        <table>
